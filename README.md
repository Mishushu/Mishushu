Hey there, folks! 👋

I'm into computers and gaming. Right now, I'm dipping my toes into the wild world of game development!

👾 Baby bird learning to flap its wings in programming.

🔮 Currently exploring the realms of Unity and Unreal engines.

🚀 Wrangling SQL and ERD databases like a pro (or at least trying to...).

🎮 On an infinite quest in RPGs.

💕 Head over heels for my Nintendo Switch!

💻 Computer science student.
